 Hi there! My name is Daniel Wicker and this my GitHub account for soccer/football work.
 The majority of my coding experience and projects will be in R, but I'm hoping to use this account to learn Python as well.
 While I'm more experienced in R, I would still say I'm learning and seriously interested in learning more through soccer!
 My DM's are always open (@DW__Analytics), but you can also reach me via email at mintcityanalytics@gmail.com.
