 Hi there! My name is Daniel Wicker and this my GitHub account for soccer/football work.
 Because my career has transitioned into the professional sphere, I have made the majority of my repositories private.
 I plan on publishing some code and analysis unrelated to my professional work soon, so stay tuned!
 My Twitter DM's are always open (@DW__Analytics), but you can also reach me via my professional website danielwicker.me.

mintcityanalytics/mintcityanalytics is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
